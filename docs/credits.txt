== Euphoria Credits
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

Euphoria has been continuously developed since it was started in 1993
by Robert Craig. In 2006, version 3.0 was released as open source. Various
releases were made to the 3.x series and then in the 4th quarter of
2010, the largest update ever was made to Euphoria, starting the
Euphoria 4.x series.

It has taken quite a few people to get this far and we would like to
recognize them here. Contributors are listed in alphabetical 
order by their last name.
