-- Normally, this test should simply create it's own ex.err by copying control.err but if the Interpreter was compiled in debug mode and matherr was available for compilation this should fail and the interpreter will create the ex.err file matching the control.err file.  As long as this test works as designed other bugs in the interpreter involving failing to check invalid values for math functions will be caught by this backup mechanism.
