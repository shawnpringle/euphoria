			--------------------------

To make learning Euphoria easier, and more fun, we have created some
very simple programs. Most of them run in trace mode. They show you 
step-by-step how to do common operations like reading in numbers, 
printing numbers, opening files etc. There are comments on most of the 
statements so someone who is new to Euphoria, or new to programming, 
can understand exactly how each program works. Most of the programs do not 
do anything useful, but they cover topics that sometimes are confusing to 
beginners.

Hopefully these interactive tutorials will be more stimulating for you than 
simply reading a lot of dull text. You can actually watch each program
executing, from the inside out, and see the values of variables etc.

Suggested Order:
 
	1. append.ex - append() and prepend()

	2. calc.ex - Simple Calculations

	3. celsius.ex - Fahrenheit to Celsius converter (simple, not traced)

	5. filesort.ex - read a file from standard input and write a sorted file
					  to standard output (not traced)

	6. getc.ex - reading a file - one character at a time

	7. gets.ex - reading a file - one line at a time

	8. hello.ex - Hello World

	9. learn.ex - test your knowledge!

	10. seqcalc.ex - Calculations on Sequences

	11. simple.ex - watch a simple sorting algorithm at work
